1. No, unit tests are meant for single small isolated peice fo code in memory and not an entire collabroation of modules i.e all the messaging parts working together, so you would need a higher-level integration instead of a unit test. Unit tests can be used for the smaller pieces such as the smaller functions but it wont be possible for the user-visible message feature.

2. Yes, a unit test would be used here single it is a single deterministic rule inside a module and not an entire component. It also fits into the definition of a unit test which is quick, isolated, and has no external dependencies.
